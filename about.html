                <p><b>Hello! My name is Giselle Morris!</b></p>
                <p>I am a student industrial designer with a minor in business. My work sits at the intersection of physical design, graphics, and problem solving, from modular containers to digital experiments and brand concepts. I like exploring how things function, how they communicate, and how they fit into everyday life. Outside of school, you will usually find me sketching, animating, or getting outside for a reset. I am always looking for new ways to learn, push my skills, and build work that is intentional and genuinely useful.</p>
                <p>In my portfolio, you will find a selection of my work that showcases my skills in concept development, prototyping, and visual communication. I am always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate with others to create impactful designs.</p>
                <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
